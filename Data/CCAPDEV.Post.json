    "body": "Hi friends. I am currently a 3rd year Civil Engineering student. I'll just say it straight out. I'm not enjoying my course. Although I haven't failed anything yet, I just don't see myself doing this in the future. I'm not happy right now. In fact, this course bores me. It's really difficult, and whenever I get a good grade . . . I feel nothing. I feel that I would be much happier in a course I actually want to be in? How do I proceed with this? I'm afraid of disappointing my parents. Wasting 2 years of Civil Eng seems very . . . wrong. What should I do? Help me out.",
